Haskell is a purely functional programming language.
It was developed by a group of PhD students embracing the power and conciseness of prior functional programming, and lambda calculus.

An important difference between imperative languages such as C, JavaScript, etc, is that we define expressions and manipulate the data with them.
In an imperative language you would define statements and modify the global state.
